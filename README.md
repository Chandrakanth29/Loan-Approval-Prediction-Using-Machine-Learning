# Loan-Approval-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
Machine Learning project to predict loan approval using Random Forest Classifier

# 🏦 Loan Approval Prediction

This project predicts whether a loan application will be approved using historical data and machine learning techniques.

## 📌 Objective

To build an end-to-end predictive model using Python that classifies loan applications as approved or rejected.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains information about applicants such as:
- Gender
- Marital Status
- Income
- Loan Amount
- Credit History
- Education Level
- Property Area

Train: `train.csv`  
Test: `test.csv`

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (RandomForestClassifier)

## 📈 Project Workflow

1. Data Loading & Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Encoding
4. Model Training (Random Forest)
5. Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Report)
6. Prediction on Test Data
7. Submission File Generation

## 📊 Key Visualizations

- Loan Status Distribution
- Approval Rates by Gender, Education, Marital Status
- Boxplots of Income vs Approval
- Heatmap of Correlation

## ✅ Results

The Random Forest Classifier achieved strong validation accuracy and performed well on unseen test data.

## 📁 Output

Final predictions saved to:  
`loan_approval_prediction.py`

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- End-to-end ML workflow
- Data preprocessing and EDA
- Model evaluation and improvement
- Business understanding of classification problems
